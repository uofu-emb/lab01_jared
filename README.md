# Lab 1
In this lab we go through the basics of makefiles.

## Basic Makefile Rules
1. Which part is the rule, the target, and the recipe? hello.txt is the target, the rule is the whole thing, and the recipe is echo "hello world!" > hellow.txt
1. Predict what will happen if you run the same command again. I predict it will say the file is up to date. If we changed the contents it makes it would update the hello.txt file.
